## ft_ls

+	for file types other than directory, ls displays file names as well as any requested associated information.

+	for each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that
	directory.

+	if no operand (argument) is given the contents of the current directory are displayed.

+	if more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory
	operands are sorted seperately and in lexicographical order.

// flags:

	-A	: include directory entries whose names begin with a dot `.' except for `.' and `..'.
	-R	: Recursively list directories encountered.
	-S	: Sort by size (largest file first) before sorting oprerands in lexicographical order.
	-a	: Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot `.'.
	-c	: Use time when file status was last changed for sorting or printing.
	-d	: Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).
	-l	: List files in the long format.
	-r	: reverse the order of the sort.
	-t	: Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first), if 2 files have the same
		  modification timestamp, sort their names in ascending lexic order, -r reverses both sort orders.
	-1	: force output to be one entry per line.

	-1 and -l oprions override each other; the last one determines the format used. 
	-c, -u and -U override each other...
	-S and -t override each other...
